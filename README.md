# Mug-and-Mingle---Coffee-Shop-Website
Assignment task

website hosted at github pages: https://kamscripts.github.io/mug-and-mingle-coffee-shop-website/

Project was developed in ubuntu os, so paths use (//), including CSS. Website loads fine with VS Code live server though. As a goal I had to create one css stylesheet for layout and one for styling elements. Eventually, style.css act as stylesheet for index.html and layout.css for remaining pages.
